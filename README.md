## 🧱 About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer with 15+ years of experience – and since 2022, fully immersed in the world of Web3.

In recent years, I've focused on **smart contract development**, **decentralized architectures**, and **cross-chain ecosystems**. I thrive at the intersection of **code quality, security, and innovation**.

## ⚡ What I’m Doing in Web3

🚀 **Solidity Development**  
  
I design and implement secure and optimized smart contracts with:
- Solidity, Foundry, Hardhat  
- OpenZeppelin & Solidstate  
- Static code analysis (Slither)

🔒 **Smart Contract Security**  
  
Security first! My contracts are:
- Covered with 100% test coverage  
- Audited with Slither & external audits  
- Monitored using Tenderly

🌉 **Cross-Chain & Interoperability**  
  
Working on projects using:
- Chainlink CCIP  
- Celer cBridge & Interchain Messaging

## 🚀 Project: [yieldz.cc](https://yieldz.cc) – A Platform for Single-Sided Staking

I'm a **main contributor** to [yieldz.cc](https://yieldz.cc). It's a decentralized platform that allows users to earn yield with just a single token. No LPs, no impermanent loss, no unnecessary complexity – just clean, simple staking. Designed for everyone from DeFi beginners to seasoned crypto users.

### 🔧 Responsibilities

- **Product Design**  
  Developed the concept for a secure and easy-to-use staking platform focused on *single-sided staking* – no LP tokens, no impermanent loss.

- **Smart Contract Development**  
  Developed and deployed all smart contracts using **Solidity**, with a focus on security and extensibility.

- **Frontend Development**  
  Built a user-friendly interface with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Connectkit** (viem), including seamless Web3 wallet integrations.

- **Backend & Infrastructure**  
  Designed and implemented backend architecture using **Node.js**, **Express** and **subgraphs**, with on-chain data handling and performance monitoring.

- **Security & Audits**  
  Led the smart contract audit process and collaborated with external auditors to ensure contract safety and protocol robustness.

- **Go-to-Market Strategy**  
  Launched the platform, defined the brand identity, and built the early adopter community from the ground up.
